<p>
You lived in seclusion, either in a sheltered community or entirely alone, for a formative part of your life. You might have been motivated by your devotion to Wujiao, which teaches the importance of harmony with nature and warns of the corrupting nature of ambition and greed, or you might have been forced to leave civilization behind by uncontrollable events. In your time apart from the clamor of society, you found quiet, solitude, and perhaps some of the answers you were looking for.
