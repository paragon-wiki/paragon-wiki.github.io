<p>
Warlocks are one of the <a href="Class.html">13 playable classes</a> in the <a href="Dashao.html">Dashao</a> setting.
</p>

<p>
Warlocks hail from the traditions of folk religion which are often practiced in rural villages and hamlets, based on sacrifice to <a href="Tutelary Dieties.html">tutelary deities</a> (sometimes referred to as ‘monsters’ by those who disapprove of the practice). A warlock gains their powers through a contract made with one such local spirit. For their part, the spirit will teach the Warlock magic which has been long lost in the human realm, but which is still remembered by the spirits. In exchange, the Warlock agrees to perform some service or sequence of services for their patron. Should the Warlock die before these services are discharged, then their soul will be unable to depart to the netherworld, and the pact will automatically fall upon the Warlock’s oldest living descendant. This process continues until the task is successfully completed, the spirit is destroyed or otherwise unable to fulfill its obligation to teach the Warlock, or else the Warlock’s bloodline dies out, in which case the souls of all Warlocks bound by the pact are consumed by the spirit.
