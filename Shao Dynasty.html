<p>
The Shao Dynasty is the current imperial dynasty. Founded by <a href="Lei Ren.html">Lei Ren</a>, later known as the Wenzu Emperor, its early years are often considered a golden age of the empire, marked by dramatic advances in philosophy and the arts. It was also during the first century of the Shao Dynasty that the <a href="The Way of the Five-Fold Path.html">Way of the Five-Fold Path</a> became widely known and practiced, complementing the local religious traditions of <a href="Wujiao.html">Wujiao</a> and <a href="Lixue.html">Lixue</a>.

<p>
Despite this cultural strength, the Shao's rule has often been tenuous. Their history is characterized by growing factionalism in court, waning imperial influence in the provinces, and frequent rebellions. These trends have reached their apex under the current <a href="Empress Zhishen.html">Empress</a>, as the <a href="White Dragon cult.html">White Dragon Rebellion</a> threatens to topple the nearly four-century-old dynasty.
