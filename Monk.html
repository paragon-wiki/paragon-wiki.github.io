<p>
Monks are one of the <a href="Class.html">13 playable classes</a> in the <a href="Dashao.html">Dashao</a> setting.
</p>

<p>
Altho they are in principle sworn to non-violence, Monks of the <a href="The Way of the Five-Fold Path.html">Five Fold Path</a> long ago learned that there are many unscrupulous people who are willing to steal from a pilgrim. In response, some <a href="Monastaries.html">monasteries</a> began to instruct their monks in martial arts, and eventually came to incorporate the practice of martial arts directly into their religious teachings as a form of active meditation. Monks from these traditions are able to sense and manipulate the <a href="Qi.html">Qi</a> of themselves and others, disabling opponents with the lightest of touches, mending their own wounds in seconds, and effortlessly performing impossible-seeming physical feats.
</p>

<p>
Adventuring monks typically interpret their vow of non-violence broadly, and believe that actions which reduce the harm suffered by sentient creatures overall are compatible with their vows, even if they themselves involve the use of force.
