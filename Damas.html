<p>
In <a href="Religion in Dashao.html#Five-Fold Path">the Way of the Five-Fold Path</a>, a Dama is a person who has attained enlightenment, but chosen to remain in the <a href="The Great Wheel.html">Great Wheel</a> until all living beings have attained enlightenment alongside them. They are thought to reside in <a href="Heaven.html">Heaven</a> where they observe the mortal world, intervening periodically when doing so will ultimately assist mortals in freeing themselves from the wheel.
</p>

<p>
Famous Damas are worshipped as dieties in their own right, often in association with particular virtues or domains.
</p>

<p>
Priests and pious individuals of the Five-Fold Path generally take a vow promising to become Damas themselves when they personally attain enlightenment.
