<p>
You are a trader, making your living by traveling across the land and porting goods from those who make them to those who need them. You are worldly, charming, and always ready to strike a deal. You might have operated independently as a peddler or a specialist in one particular type of merchandise, or you might have worked as an employee of a larger mercantile company.
</p>

<p>
While some merchants manage to attain considerable wealth, a certain stigma surrounds the members of your class, who are stereotypically seen as greedy, unproductive and disloyal. You should consider how this stereotype shapes the way that your character thinks of themselves, and whether they embrace it or try to fight against it.
