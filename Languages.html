<p>
<a href="Dashao.html">Dashao</a> is, for the most part, a monolingual society. The common tongue is spoken by nearly everyone within the empire. However, the empire is vast, and there can be significant variation in language at the local level. In addition, the three major minority ethnic groups - the <a href="Dapi People.html">Dapi</a>, <a href="Sading People.html">Sading</a>, and the <a href="Shanyou People.html">Shanyou</a> - each have their own languages which are unrelated to the common tongue.
</p>

<p>
Every character is presumed to be at least conversant in the common tongue. In addition, each character starts the game with knowledge of one additional language, which might be either a regional dialect of the common tongue, or else one of the minority languages. Your background or class might grant you additional languages - these can likewise be either dialects of the common tongue or one of the three foreign languages.
</p>

<p>
Regional dialects of the common tongue are, for the most part, mutually intelligible. However, knowledge of a region's dialect will identify you as a native of the area, and will often ingratiate you to the locals. As such, the main effect of your choice of language is to determine where in Dashao your character will be accepted as a local, and where they will seem to be an outsider. When choosing your languages, you should consider what your character's home province is, as well as where they might have travelled, and whether they would have had any contact with minority populations.
