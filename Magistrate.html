<p>
Magistrates are the lowest ranking officials appointed by the central government, presiding over individual <a href="County.html">counties</a>. They are responsible for appointing civil servants, including the chief of police for each <a href="Township.html">township</a>, and storing grain in preparation for famine. Their primary duty, however, is as judge. Magistrates are responsible for hearing and deciding all criminal complaints brought before them, and when witness testimony is insufficient, they have the authority to investigate the matter as they see fit, including through the interrogation of those involved.
