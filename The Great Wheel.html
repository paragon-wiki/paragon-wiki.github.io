<p>
The Great Wheel is a fundamental religious principle in the <a href="Religion in Dashao.html#Five-Fold Path">Way of the Five-Fold Path</a>. Followers believe that all living beings grow entangled with the world, binding them to an endless cycle of death and rebirth. Escape is only possible through enlightenment, by which a person is able to transcend physical objects and needs.
</p>

<p>
It is generally believed that, while enlightenment <em>can</em> be attained in a lifetime, to do so requires living the ascetic life of a monk. Because monks are dependent on the charity of others, this is only possible for a small number of people. For this reason, most followers of the Way don't attempt to escape the wheel in this life. Rather, they strive to ensure that the attachments they do form are positive and not negative, by living virtuously and honoring the monastics. In this way, they ensure that they will have a better chance of being reborn as a monk in a future life, or at least as a person of higher status. 
</p>

<p>
All followers of the Way take a vow promising that, even if they do attain enlightenment, they will voluntarily remain in the cycle as sages, called <a href="Damas.html">Damas</a>, until they succeed in helping all other living beings escape alongside them.
