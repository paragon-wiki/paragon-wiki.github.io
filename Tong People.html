<p>
The Tong are the dominant ethnic group in Dashao, and make up well over 90% of the population within the empire. While they trace their roots to the river valleys of the northwest, they have come to control a vast territory, stretching from scorching deserts in the south to frozen mountain peaks in the north, unified under the rule of the <a href="Empress Zhishen.html">Empress</a>.
</p>

<p>
Physically, the Tong are of unexceptional height, with complexions ranging from brown to light gold. Their hair is almost uniformly black and straight, and is worn long with few exceptions - a symptom of a pervasive cultural hostility to body modification, which also extends to piercings and tattoos. 
</p>

<p>
Life in Tong lands is dominated by the expansive and increasingly corrupt imperial bureaucracy, which has caused a great deal of unrest in recent years. This has culminated explosively in the White Dragon rebellion, which has come to control much of Hu province, and spawned countless copycat movements across the empire. This chaos has brought with it a corresponding rise in banditry, and the reappearance of monster populations normally kept in check by government forces.

<p>
While somewhat prone to chauvanism in other respects, the Tong are flexible when it comes to religion, and most freely pick and choose between the teachings of <a href="Religion in Dashao.html">popular sects</a>. The main cultural touchstones shared by almost all Tong are a reverance for ones' ancestors and belief in Heaven, which is both a supernatural force acting on the world and an ideal model of the state.
