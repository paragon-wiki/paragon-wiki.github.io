<p>
Barbarians are one of the <a href="Class.html">13 playable classes</a> in the <a href="Dashao.html">Dashao</a> setting. 
</p>

<p>
Barbarians are among the most formidable warriors to be found under heaven. Rather than memorizing the forms and patterns of the martial arts, they rely on sheer force, unflinching will, and chaotic unpredictability to overcome their opponents. In combat, they enter battle trances which render them inhumanly strong and all but oblivious to injury. Different types of barbarians draw on different sources to entire these trances, variously channeling animal spirits, invoking the spirits of their ancestors, or simply succumbing to blinding rage and bloodlust.
</p>

<p>
While the people of Dashao often refer to those from different cultures as 'barbarians', Barbarians in the sense of the playable class can hail from any culture.

There are three subclasses for the Barbarian that are allowed by default in Dashao. Ask your DM if you want to use a subclass beyond the ones listed here.
