<div id="Noble"><h2 id="Noble" class="header"><a href="#Noble">Noble</a></h2></div>

<p>
Your are a member of a noble family, living off of the income from a <a href="Noble Titles.html">fief</a> granted to one of your ancestors. In modern times, the nobility officially has almost no political power, and noble titles are usually handed out as rewards for serving the <a href="Emperor.html">Empress</a> with distinction. In all probability, your days have been spent on luxury and intellectual or artistic pursuits, feasting on fine food, playing music in the garden, and studying the histories of your ancestors.
</p>

<p>
Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate title. While a noble title on its own carries few responsibilities, many noble estates acquire enough wealth to wield considerable political influence behind the scenes. You should also work with your DM to describe your family and their influence on you.
</p>

<p>
Is your family old and established, or was your title only recently bestowed? What kind of reputation does your family have among the other aristocrats of the region? How do the common people regard them? What deed did your ancestor perform which resulted in them being given a fief by the Empress?
</p>

<p>
What's your position in the family? Are you the heir to the head of the family? Have you already inhereted the title? How do you feel about that responsibility? Or are you so far down the line of inheritance that nobody cares what you do, so long as you don't embarrass your family? Are you in your family's good graces, or shunned by the rest of your family?
