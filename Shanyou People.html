<p>
The Shanyou (Shenja in their own language) are a large and diverse group of semi-nomadic peoples who live in the towering and austere mountains in and around eastern Hu province. While they have no common ruler, they are united by their common devotion to the Way of the Five-Fold Path.
</p>

<p>
Physically, Shanyou tend to be short and bulky, with brown skin and ruddy complexions. Their hair tends to be dark and curly. Laymen and women typically wear it long, while monks of either sex shave it off entirely.
</p>

<p>
Shanyou communities typically have separate spiritual and secular authorities, with kings and queens managing the trade and defense of the community, and spiritual leaders called Tabras advising the monarch and attending to religious matters. This arrangement is often to the benefit of both parties, as the intense respect that most Shanyou have for monks is translated into legitimacy for the monarch, while the monarch is able to protect and provide for the monks, whose religious vows forbid them from violence and laboring for coin.
</p>

<p>
Among the laity, most Shanyou are involved in one way or another with the care of Burvaks, a type of towering, shaggy, four-horned beast whose fur, milk, meat and bones provide most of the materials and sustenance used in daily life.
</p>

<p>
The Shanyou generally have peaceful relations with their Tong neighbors, who have historically lacked the desire to exert any serious territorial claim to the rugged and hostile terrain that the Shanyou call home. In the past century, the Way of the Five-Fold Path has become quite popular among the Tong, and it is now not uncommon to see Tong men and women making pilgrimages to holy sites in Shanyou lands, or seeking admission as acolytes in Shanyou monastaries. Conversely, most Shanyou found in Tong lands are merchants, drawn by the relative wealth of the Shao and the ever-growing demand for religious tokens and trinkets.
