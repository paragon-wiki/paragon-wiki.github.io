<p>
The Emperor(ess) is the head of the imperial government, and wields near absolute power. They are the commander-in-chief of the military, and have the power to appoint officials to any of the high-ranking positions of the central government. They also have the authority to unilaterally modify the law, and act as a supreme judge.
</p>

<p>
The position is hereditary, and each dynasty is associated with the rule of a particular clan. In the current Shao dynasty, the Lei clan has held the emperorship.
