<p>
 Rangers are one of the <a href="Class.html">13 playable classes</a> in the <a href="Dashao.html">Dashao</a> setting.
</p>
 
<p>
 The lands within Dashao have been long-since tamed by the spade and plow, but the safety of the interior holds only tenuously at the frontiers of the great empire. Rangers are the men and women who live and fight in these borderlands, where terrible monsters roam and fell spirits lurk. Whether they fight on behalf of their sovereign or simply for themselves and their families, they are unparalleled survivalists, united by an unforgiving pragmatism and a devotion to protecting their lands. 
</p>

<p>
Beyond these common features, however, rangers are a diverse group. While some fight in the constant border skirmishes between Dashao and the various other groups who live at the edge of empire, others see themselves as intermediaries between the different cultures, incorporating both barbarian spiritual practices and Dashao martial arts into their fighting styles. Likewise, while some see themselves as masters over nature, others see themselves as natureâ€™s allies, opposing anything which they believe would disrupt the balance of the land.
