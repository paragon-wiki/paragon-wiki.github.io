<p>
Warsages are one of the <a href="Class.html">13 playable classes</a> in the <a href="Dashao.html">Dashao</a> setting.
</p>

<p>
Warsages are students of the Art of War, unequalled in their cunning and knowledge of strategy. Whether military commanders, bandit chieftains, or students of history, they are never without a plan, and seldom without two or three. While they are often at least familiar with martial arts, their true strength lies in their ability to assist and coordinate their allies, turning a group of individuals into something greater than the sum of its parts. They are generally well respected in the world of Dashao, particularly by members of the government or military, but they are also regarded with a certain suspicion; throughout the ages, Warsages have been at the root of countless coups and conspiracies.
