It is the year 383, and the once-mighty <a href="Shao Dynasty.html">Shao Dynasty</a> lies in ruins. Fires burn and fields lay fallow as millions of peasants are swept up in open rebellion against the corrupt and failing state. Waning imperial power has opened the door to countless warlords and other petty tyrants, each vying to found the dynasty which will replace the ailing Shao. And those scant few men and women still loyal to <a href="Empress Zhishen.html">the Empress</a>, facing enemies on every side, must further contend with the scheming of the palace slaves and other court officials, who are often more concerned with preserving their wealth and standing than with serving their ruler.

Into this backdrop of open civil war and ever-shifting alliances emerge the <a href="Paragons.html">Paragons</a>. First prophesied by <a href="Zhao Jiang.html">Zhao Jiang</a>, charismatic leader of the <a href="White Dragon cult.html">White Dragon cult</a> and instigator of the peasant rebellion, these 108 men and women are thought to be heavenly spirits in human form. Blessed with awesome power, they are destined to cleanse the corruption of the Shao and instate a new order, bringing peace to the fractured nation.

The nature of the future which the Paragons will bring about is uncertain, not least to the Paragons themselves. But, it is clear that it will be impossible for any Paragon to remain neutral in the coming conflict. Warlords, magistrates and rebels alike will stop at little to earn their loyalties, but many would be equally content with their destruction. And all the while, the Paragons are hounded by the mysterious <a href="Tianlao.html">Tianlao</a>, powerful spirits who wield chains of golden light and seem to be single-mindedly bent on their capture.

You are a paragon. Whether you meet your destiny with enthusiasm or with reluctance, the awakening of your powers has forced you to abandon your old life and thrust you into the center of a merciless civil war. For now, your mandate is to survive, and to learn to master the strength which lies within you. But in time, the very fate of the world may come to rest upon the decisions you make and the alliances you forge. Choose them wisely.
