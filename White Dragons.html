<p>
The White Dragons are a militant sect of <a href="Religion in Dashao.html#Wujiao">Wujiao</a>, led by the prophet <a href="Zhao Jiang.html">Zhao Jiang</a>. They believe that the <a href="Shao Dynasty.html">Shao Dynasty</a> has lost its way, and that the White Dragons, in cooperation with the <a href="Paragons.html">Paragons</a> originally prophecied by Zhao Jiang, must depose the <a href="Empress Zhishen.html">Empress</a> and instate a new order of peace and enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
While similar movements have existed in the past, the combination of the growing corruption of the Shao, unpopular policies attempting to suppress folk religious traditions, and a series of natural disasters which left tens of thousands of southern peasants without livelihoods have all contributed to make the White Dragons gain new followers at an incredible rate. Following the open declaration of rebellion in 379, the rebels have come to control a large portion of <a href="Hu Province.html">Hu Province</a>, and copycat movements have erupted in several other provinces across the empire as well.
</p>

<p>
The political philosophy of the White Dragons - and Wujiao in general - emphasizes the importance of individual freedom. In their conception, the ideal sovereign does as little as possible, preferring to allow their subjects to be guided by their own natures. The corruption of the massive Shao bureaucracy is seen as proof of the dangers of over-governance and unchecked authority, which is both spiritually toxic and materially harmful.
</p>

<p>
In accordance with this philosophy, the White Dragons are dominated by local leaders. While Zhao Jiang is respected as a prophet and looked to for guidance, he typically restricts himself to dictating the grand strategy of the movement and clarifying its theology, while leaving the execution to be decided on the local level. As a result, there is considerable variation in both the aims and methods of the different branches of the rebellion, ranging from nonviolent priestly orders concerned with spreading the theological message of the movement, to groups of bandits who adopt the superficial trappings of the movement to grant legitimacy to their activities while having little interest in its political goals, and everything in between.
