<p>
Druid is one of the <a href="Class.html">13 playable classes</a> in the <a href="Dashao.html">Dashao</a> setting.
</p>

<p>
Druids are an eclectic group of hermits and mystics, who are almost always devout followers of <a href="Wujiao.html">Wujiao</a>. Their tradition strongly emphasizes the importance of harmony with nature, and believes that lust for fame and fortune is destructive to the spirit. By withdrawing from society and freeing themselves from these toxic influences, they come to understand the Way of <a href="Heaven.html">Heaven</a>, and unfetter the magical powers which they believe lie within all humans. Adventuring Druids are usually concerned with eliminating the unnatural from the world, but the precise definition of what is ‘unnatural’ varies from Druid to Druid, as does the degree to which the Druid is willing to use violence to accomplish this goal.
