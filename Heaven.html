<p>
The people of Dashao see the universe as being divided into three realms, corresponding to Heaven, Earth, and People. Heaven plays several roles in this cosmology:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
It is the afterlife to which spirits depart, and the dwelling place of ancestral spirits and deities.

<li>
It is a force for moral retribution, which sees to it that the wicked are punished and that the virtuous find success.

<li>
It is a vast bureaucracy, headed by the <a href="Azure Emperor.html">Azure Emperor</a>, which serves as the model and justification for imperial authority on earth. 

</ul>
