<div id="Religion in Dashao"><h1 id="Religion in Dashao" class="header"><a href="#Religion in Dashao">Religion in Dashao</a></h1></div>

<p>
There are three major religious traditions in Dashao: <a href="Wujiao.html">Wujiao</a>, <a href="Lixue.html">Lixue</a>, and <a href="The Way of the Five-Fold Path.html">The Way of the Five-Fold Path</a>.
</p>

<div id="Religion in Dashao-Wujiao"><h2 id="Wujiao" class="header"><a href="#Religion in Dashao-Wujiao">Wujiao</a></h2></div>

<p>
The tradition of Wujiao, or the Way of Nothingness, teaches that suffering is the result of humans behaving against their true nature. It esteems that which is effortless, natural, and intuitive, while condemning artifice and excessive desire. For followers of Wujiao, the person who does the least will accomplish the most, and the person who knows the least is the wisest. Its core principle is of duality, and the constant nature of change; just as the sun and moon trade places in the sky, fortune and misfortune are never far from one another’s heels. To live a happy life, one must live in harmony with these changes, rather than attempting to fight against them.
</p>

<p>
Wujiao features several staple deities, such as the <a href="Azure Emperor.html">Azure Emperor</a> who rules over heaven, but it often also integrates local deities from different traditions, and there are many different pantheons which are worshiped across the land. Its priests maintain temples and perform religious rites, but typically have families and live outside of the temple grounds.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="White Dragon cult.html">White Dragon Rebellion</a> is based on a sect of Wujiao, led by the charismatic prophet <a href="Zhao Jiang.html">Zhao Jiang</a>. Claiming to have spoken to messengers of heaven, Zhao Jiang and his followers believe that the rampant corruption and overreach of the <a href="Shao Dynasty.html">Shao Dynasty</a> indicate that it has lost the way of heaven, and must be replaced with a new dynasty that will rule in accordance with the principles of Wujiao, ushering in a period of peace and enlightenment.
</p>

<div id="Religion in Dashao-Lixue"><h2 id="Lixue" class="header"><a href="#Religion in Dashao-Lixue">Lixue</a></h2></div>

<p>
Lixue, or the School of Rituals, teaches that humans are, by nature, ambitious and greedy. These negative tendencies must be tempered and pacified through social bonds and the careful performance of ritual. The most important such bond is that of parent to child, which is thought to mirror the proper relationship of sovereign to subject. More generally, a major component of Lixue is respect for one's elders. It is common for groups of friends to share their dates of birth and establish hierarchies of age, which govern the way that they refer to one another and can be used as a basis for resolving otherwise intractable disputes.
</p>

<p>
There are no temples or priests of Lixue, as the tradition holds that the affairs of humanity should take precedence over the affairs of the spirits. Nonetheless, <a href="Ancestor Worship.html">ancestor worship</a> is the most important of its many rituals, and most homes contain a shrine for this purpose. Typically, families will worship the first member of their <a href="Clan.html">clan</a> who settled on the land where they now live, but it is also common to worship heroes of legend who share the family’s surname, or the sovereign themselves, who is ideally a mother and father to all people. In gratitude for their family’s piety, the earthly spirit of this ancestor will in turn watch over their descendants and protect them from harm.
</p>

<div id="Religion in Dashao-Five-Fold Path"><h2 id="Five-Fold Path" class="header"><a href="#Religion in Dashao-Five-Fold Path">Five-Fold Path</a></h2></div>

<p>
The way of the Five-Fold Path is a relatively young tradition, first practiced by the nomadic herdsmen of the snowy eastern mountains. It teaches that through every action, a person accumulates <a href="Qi.html">qi</a>, which binds them to a cycle of endless rebirth, called <a href="The Great Wheel.html">The Great Wheel</a>. By acting virtuously, a person can accumulate positive qi and as a result will be reincarnated with higher social status, or possibly even in one of the heavens as a demigod. But, the ultimate goal of a follower of the Path is to sever all attachment to the physical world, both positive and negative, thereby attaining enlightenment. Altho one who has attained enlightenment could choose to escape the cycle, followers of the Path take a vow to remain in the Wheel until they have helped all living beings attain enlightenment alongside them. 
</p>

<p>
The central tenets of the Five-Fold Path are nonviolence and abstention from vice, but lay people seldom follow these requirements strictly. The rites and doctrine of the Path are maintained by independent <a href="Monastaries.html">monastic orders</a>, which are usually but not always single-sex, self-sufficient, and isolated from urban life.
</p>

<p>
While it may seem that these traditions would naturally conflict with one another, very few people see them in this way. Most people of the world believe that all three have their strong points, and freely pick and choose from their respective teachings as seems appropriate. Thus, an enlightened sage of the Five Fold Path might come to be worshipped as a deity by priests of Wujiao, and a scholar-official might worship the Azure Emperor as a means of cultivating a proper attitude to their own, earthly sovereign. These major traditions are also frequently interwoven with folk religion and the worship of <a href="Tutelary Dieties.html">guardian spirits</a> (sometimes called monsters by those with a less charitable attitude), who protect individual towns and communities in exchange for the devotion and generosity of their people.
