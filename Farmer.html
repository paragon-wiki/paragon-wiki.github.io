<p>
You grew up working the land, the rhythm of your life dictated by the shifting of the seasons and the coming of rains. You might have worked alongside dozens of others as a tenant on a noble's plantation, or else you might have tended to a small plot of land which has been handed down through your family for generations. Whatever the case may be, you have developed a closeness with the land and an affinity for nature which no city-dweller could understand.
