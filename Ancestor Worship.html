In <a href="Religion in Dashao.html#Wujiao">Wujiao</a> and <a href="Religion in Dashao.html#Lixue">Lixue</a>, it is thought that each person has two souls: one earthly, and one heavenly. When they die, if they are treated with reverance and respect, then their heavenly soul will keep watch over their descendents from <a href="Heaven.html">heaven</a> and bless them with good fortune. If they are not mourned or properly laid to rest, then their earthly spirit will return as undead to exact vengeance. This belief is the foundation of the custom of ancestor worship, which is one of the most widespread customs in <a href="Dashao.html">Dashao</a>.

It all begins with proper mourning. When a parent passes away, a filial child must mourn them for 54 days, during which time they dress all in white and abstain from meat and wine. Sacrificial incense and paper money must be burned, while priests must be retained to perform the necessary rituals and oversee the burial.

Thereafter, every proper home contains an ancestral shrine, furnished with clay tablets representing the ancestral spirits. Worship is most commonly directed towards the most senior ancestors. In particular, ancestors who performed noteworthy deeds in life, ancestors who settled the land on which the family now lives, and especially the ancestor who founded the family's <a href="Clan.html">Clan</a>.
