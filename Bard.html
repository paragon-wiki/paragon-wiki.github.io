<p>
Bards are one of the <a href="Class.html">13 playable classes</a> in the <a href="Dashao.html">Dashao</a> setting.
</p>

<p>
Music is of central importance to many of the religious traditions in the Dashao setting. For the followers of <a href="Religion in Dashao.html#Lixue">Lixue</a>, music, when played according to the rules laid out in the <a href="The Eight Classics.html">Classic of Song</a>, is a means of refining the soul of both the player and the listener. For followers of <a href="Religion in Dashao.html#Wujiao">Wujiao</a>, music played properly is the ultimate means of self-expression, fluid and spontaneous, bringing the musician in harmony with nature. Elite practitioners of either school are able to use their music to sway hearts, conjure illusions, and heal the wounded. Bards who prefer the tradition of Lixue typically belong to the College of Lore, while Bards who prefer the tradition of Wujiao typically belong to the College of Valor.
</p>

<p>
Mechanically: Bards in Dashao can use either Intelligence or Charisma as their spellcasting ability, depending on whether their style of music is more formalistic (like that of the followers of Lixue), or more improvisatory (like that of the followers of Wujiao). If a player chooses to use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, then they become proficient in Intelligence saves instead of Charisma saves, and their uses of Bardic Inspiration are based on their Intelligence modifier.
