<p>
You have spent your life in the service of a <a href="Monastaries.html">monastic order</a>, following the <a href="The Way of the Five-Fold Path.html">Way of the Five-Fold Path</a>. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the sacred and mundane, performing sacred rites and meditating on sutras. You are not necessarily a <a href="Monk.html">monk</a>; not all monasteries instruct their acolytes in martial arts.
</p>

<p>
While serving their temple, acolytes typically take on vows of chastity, nonviolence, and poverty, and depend on the donations of local laypeople for survival. You should determine how strictly your character takes these prohibitions as an adventurer. While some acolytes are steadfast in their vows, many are willing to bend or reinterpret them when necessary, and some former acolytes renounce them entirely.
