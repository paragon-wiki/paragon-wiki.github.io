<div id="Politics of Dashao"><h1 id="Politics of Dashao" class="header"><a href="#Politics of Dashao">Politics of Dashao</a></h1></div>

<p>
Dashao is a large empire with an equally sprawling bureaucracy. There are a bewildering variety of ministerial posts and appointments at every level, from isolated townships to the imperial court. This document outlines the basic strokes.
</p>

<div id="Politics of Dashao-Imperial Government"><h3 id="Imperial Government" class="header"><a href="#Politics of Dashao-Imperial Government">Imperial Government</a></h3></div>

<p>
The empire as a whole is ruled by the <a href="Empress Zhishen.html">Empress</a>. She is the highest political and military authority, and in theory there is little limit to her power. In practice, however, most of her responsibilities are delegated, and she seldom takes a direct hand in politics.
</p>

<p>
Beneath the Empress are the three excellencies - the Chancellor, the Grand Commandant, and the Councelor. The Chancellor is largely responsible for the functioning of the civil government, while the Grand Commandant controls the military. The Councelor occupies a more administrative role, overseeing local officials and monitoring abuse of authority.
</p>

<p>
Each of the three excellencies oversees 3 ministries. In total, these 9 ministries manage all of the affairs of the government at the imperial level.
</p>

<div id="Politics of Dashao-Provincal Government"><h3 id="Provincal Government" class="header"><a href="#Politics of Dashao-Provincal Government">Provincal Government</a></h3></div>

<p>
The empire is then divided into <a href="Province.html">10 provinces</a>, with the capital as a special administrative division under the direct control of the court. Each province is controlled by a <a href="Governor.html">governor</a>, who is supposed to be centrally appointed. With the waning influence of the court in recent years, however, the governerships have become de-facto hereditary positions.
</p>

<p>
Each governor additionally oversees provincal auditors and administrators who oversee the smooth functioning of government and commerce in the area.
</p>

<div id="Politics of Dashao-County Government"><h3 id="County Government" class="header"><a href="#Politics of Dashao-County Government">County Government</a></h3></div>

<p>
Each province contains many <a href="County.html">counties</a>, which are presided over by <a href="Magistrate.html">magistrates</a>. Magistrates are the lowest level official which is directly appointed by the imperial court. They are responsible for appointing lower level officials, as well as arbiting over legal disputes in their county.
</p>

<div id="Politics of Dashao-Township Government"><h3 id="Township Government" class="header"><a href="#Politics of Dashao-Township Government">Township Government</a></h3></div>

<p>
Finally, each county is broken up into <a href="Township.html">townships</a>, consisting of towns, cities, and their surrounding lands. Each township is managed by a mayor, who is often chosen by locals, and a chief of police, who is responsible for enforcing the law.
</p>

<div id="Politics of Dashao-A note on noble titles"><h3 id="A note on noble titles" class="header"><a href="#Politics of Dashao-A note on noble titles">A note on noble titles</a></h3></div>

<p>
While <a href="Noble Titles.html">Noble Titles</a> are common, they entail no particular political power. Nobles are merely responsible for collecting taxes from the households on their fief, from which they can draw a (often substantial) income. In practice, the wealth that noble families acquire can make them politically influential, however.
