<p>
The Sading are a seagoing people native to the snowy islands at the extreme northern end of Hei province and beyond. Bold and opportunistic, they have historically rankled under the rule of the Empress, and with the weakening of the court in recent decades, they have grown ever more independent from Imperial authority.
</p>

<p>
Physically, the Sading are tall and fair skinned, with mostly-straight hair in shades of brown, red, and blonde. They often have high cheekbones and cold eyes of blue or grey. Tattoos are common among them, and are used for both for religious purposes and to commemorate greed deeds and events.
</p>

<p>
The Sading almost all live in coastal areas, and have a strong affinity for the sea. Many are fisherman, shipbuilders, merchants, or, on occasion, pirates.
