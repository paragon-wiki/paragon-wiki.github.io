<p>
Almost every man or woman of <a href="Tong People.html">Tong</a> descent belongs to one of the Hundred Clans. In ancient times, the Sage-Kings invented the custom of surnames, and placed strict laws on their use. The right to create a new surname was one of the highest honors they could offer, awarded only to heros who served the state to their utmost. Each clan traces their lineage back to one such figure, who is worshipped by every household in the clan alike.

<p>
While some of the smallest clans are closely associated with a particular area, most are spread far and wide, and encompass thousands of households. Nonetheless, there is in general a fair amount of implicit trust between people of the same surname, who will often affectionately refer to one another as 'cousin' or 'uncle' or 'aunt,' even if they've never personally met before.
</p>

<p>
Every clan also maintains a clanhall, which is a large <a href="Ancestor Worship.html">ancestral shrine</a> dedicated to the founder of the clan. It is common for people to make at least one pilgrimage to their family's clanhall at some point in their lives.

The surname of the Empress was Lei before she assumed the throne, and so the Lei are the current imperial clan. While this confers no direct benefit, several court positions are reserved for those with the surname Lei, and in general the Lei family is overrepresented in most levels of the imperial government.

These are the one-hundred most common clans, ordered from largest to smallest, in the present day:
