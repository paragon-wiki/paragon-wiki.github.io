<p>
The Tianlao are a group of powerful spirits. In stature, they are similar to a man, but taller and broader. Their skin, however, glows with a gleaming golden light, obscuring whatever features they might possess. They are protected by armor of some celestial metal unknown to mortals, and wield in their hands long chains of golden light, which are searing hot to the touch.
</p>

<p>
Unattested to in scripture, the Tianlao appeared only shortly after the Paragons themselves. It is conjectured that they are pursuing the Paragons, but scholars can only speculate as to their purposein so doing. Whatever the case may be, they are relentless, and seem to require neither sustenance nor rest as they hunt for their quarries.

<p>
It is unknown what happens to a Paragon captured by the Tianlao.
