<p>
Wizards are one of the <a href="Class.html">13 playable classes</a> in the <a href="Dashao.html">Dashao</a> setting.
</p>

<p>
The tradition of wizardry is said to have been invented by the <a href="Sage-King Zhao.html">Sage-King Zhao</a>, and passed down through the <a href="The Eight Classics.html">Eight Classics</a>. Tradition holds that, because Zhao realized the danger of the powers of Wizardry falling into the hands of an unworthy or unscrupulous person, he encoded different aspects of the practice into each of the Eight Classics. In this way, to become a Wizard, a person must first devote themselves to the careful study of the classics, by which means they will inevitably also learn the virtue and temperance required to use their powers responsibly.

<p>
Abjuration is taught in the Annals of Earth and Stone, which records the wars between the early dynasties and the <a href="Dapi People.html">Dapi</a> coalition of southern barbarians. Conjuration is taught in the Book of Hills and Valleys, which describes the many varieties of monsters and spirits which can be found under <a href="Heaven.html">Heaven</a>. Divination is taught in the Classic of Heaven and its Way, which describes the nature of the cosmos and methods for interpreting the results of augury. Enchantment is taught in the Book of Song, which describes the 7 scales and 13 meters of music which elevate the soul. Evocation is taught in the Classic of Sun and Moon, which describes the countless cycles and forces of the natural world. Illusion is taught in the Book of Odes, which presents the poetry of the great masters of Zhao’s day, who could make it seem as if the listener was truly seeing the scenes they described. Necromancy is taught in the Book of Rites, which describes the <a href="Ancestor Worship.html">proper ways to honor one’s ancestors.</a> Finally, Transmutation is taught in the Classic of Elements, which describes the <a href="Wuxing.html">five fundamental components of nature</a> and the ways they can be combined to treat illness and assure longevity.

A Wizard’s spellbook accordingly consists of their own copy of the Eight Classics. Spells are learned when a Wizard comes to deeply understand a particular passage, to the point where they are able to personally annotate it. To prepare a spell, a Wizard reviews their own annotations, reminding themselves of the deeper meaning of the text. In general, low level spells correspond to the simpler, introductory sections in each of the classics, while high level spells often correspond to esoteric or seemingly contradictory passages. Wizards naturally acquire new spells as they level up based on their own personal studies, but by engaging the services of a tutor or finding commentaries in their travels, they can expand their repertoire. This functions in the same way as learning spells from scrolls in core 5e.
