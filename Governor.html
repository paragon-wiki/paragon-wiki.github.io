<p>
The Governor is the head of a provincal government, and the most powerful official outside of the imperial court. While nominally an appointed position, the weakening of the court in recent years has caused it to become de-facto hereditary. Since the outbreak of the White Dragon Rebellion, the governors have been granted authority to raise personal armies in defense of their provinces. While the defeat of the imperial army in Hu province perhaps made such a thing inevitable, many fear that the newfound independence of the governors will lead to untold chaos in the years to come.
