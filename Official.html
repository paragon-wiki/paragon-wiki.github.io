<p>
You found employ as a civil servant in the massive bureaucracy which runs the state. Most officials attain their rank by passing the imperial examinations, a grueling system of exams designed to test an applicant's knowledge of the <a href="The Eight Classics.html">classics</a> and literary style. Others, however, come by their ranks through the nomination of a high ranking official. Whatever the case may be, you are a member of the gentry, well educated and intimately familiar with the mechanisms of power.
