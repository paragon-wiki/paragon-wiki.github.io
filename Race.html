<p>
All characters in <a href="Dashao.html">Dashao</a> are humans. There are a number of distinct ethnic groups who live within the empire, but there are no mechanical differences between them.
</p>

<p>
The most common ethnic groups are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="Tong People.html">Tong</a>: the dominant ethnic group in Dashao, originally from the fertile river valleys of the west, who compose the large majority of the empire's population.

<li>
<a href="Sading People.html">Sading</a>: a sea-going people hailing from the snowy islands at the far northern extent of the empire.

<li>
<a href="Shanyou People.html">Shanyou</a>: A semi-nomadic people native to the expansive mountain ranges in the far east.

<li>
<a href="Dapi People.html">Dapi</a>: a loose confederation of nomadic tribes, spread across the vast desert at the southern edge of the empire.

</ul>

<p>
Tong cultural institutions are dominant in most areas of Dashao, and many Tong are given to dismissing other cultures in their entirety as 'barbaric'. Nonetheless, influences from the Sading, Shanyou and Dapi can be felt throughout the empire. Most notably, the <a href="The Way of the Five-Fold Path.html">Way of the Five Fold Path</a> was introduced to Dashao through the Shanyou. Its enthusiastic adoption has somewhat eased cultural prejudices against minority groups in general, and the Shanyou in particular.
