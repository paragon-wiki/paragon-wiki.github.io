<p>
Rogues are one of the <a href="Class.html">13 playable classes</a> in the <a href="Dashao.html">Dashao</a> setting.
</p>

<p>
Daring and unconventional, the only thing which unites rogues is their flexibility and tendency towards innovation. To a rogue, concepts like convention and tradition serve only to fetter new ideas, and better results can often be obtained by doing precisely the opposite of what one is compelled to do. Thus, if the Treatise on the Eighteen Weapons says that you should face the enemy head on and strike at their blade, then a rogue will instead approach an enemy from the side and strike where they least expect it. If scholarly tradition says that poetry must be mastered before a study of Illusion magic can begin, the rogue will simply laugh and jump immediately to studying the magic which grabs their interests.
</p>

<p>
While rogues are less likely to respect laws and institutions which they see as senseless, they are not in general any more given to cruelty or selfishness than the typical adventurer. Many see the rogueâ€™s willingness to adapt to changing circumstances as a sign of wisdom and a deep understanding of the teachings of <a href="Wujiao.html">Wujiao</a>, and some rogues have become known as sages or philosophers of the tradition. The skills of the rogue are also highly esteemed in many parts of the military, where tradition has long held that a general must be willing to forget established strategy or even ignore the orders of their sovereign if the situation demands it.
