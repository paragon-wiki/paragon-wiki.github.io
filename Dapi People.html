<p>
The Dapi are a loose confedaration of nomadic peoples native to the steppe and desert south of the empire. Throughout history, such groups of tribes have posed a persistent threat to their settled neighbors. Under normal circumstances, the Shao would attempt to diffuse the risk by placating powerful tribes with lavish gifts and playing rival communities against each other, but in recent years the warlord <a href="Kurgen.html">Kurgen</a> has succeeded in uniting many old enemies together under his banner.

<p>
Physically, the Dapi tend to have tan complexions and narrow features, with dark hair that can be curly or straight. When not riding, men and women alike tend to wear billowing robes of light fabric which protect them from the desert heat.

The Dapi have a long tradition of animal husbandry, and have tamed a large number of beasts which would be considered monsters in other lands. They are most closely associated with the large, spitting lizards that they use as mounts and beasts of burden, but many other dangerous and magical creatures can be found among their camps.

Most Dapi practice an indigenous religious whose foundations are ritual bathing and the worship of Gamni, a type of powerful spirit that can be found throughout the southern deserts. A significant number of them also follow the Way of the Five-Fold Path, however, as a result of centuries of contact with the <a href="Shanyou People.html">Shanyou</a>.
