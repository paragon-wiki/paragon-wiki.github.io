<div id="House Rules"><h2 id="House Rules" class="header"><a href="#House Rules">House Rules</a></h2></div>

<div id="House Rules-Traits"><h3 id="Traits" class="header"><a href="#House Rules-Traits">Traits</a></h3></div>

<p>
When generating your character, you can choose or randomly determine personality traits based on your ability scores. See: <a href="Traits.html">Traits</a>.
</p>

<div id="House Rules-Ability Checks"><h3 id="Ability Checks" class="header"><a href="#House Rules-Ability Checks">Ability Checks</a></h3></div>

<p>
Skill checks aren't tied to ability scores. Which ability you use for a check can differ based on the circumstances.
</p>

<p>
For example, say you're trying to intimidate someone. If you're doing it through verbal threats, then you might make a Charisma (Intimidate) check. If you're doing it by physically invading their space, then it might be a Strength (Intimidate) check instead.
</p>

<p>
Whenever you're doing something that requires a check, the DM will tell you which ability score and which proficiency applies.
</p>

<div id="House Rules-Weapons"><h3 id="Weapons" class="header"><a href="#House Rules-Weapons">Weapons</a></h3></div>

<p>
This game will use the <a href="https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LKSfOTqZXP5nBPM652j">Modular Weapons</a> system, with the extension that all characters who are proficient in simple or martial weapons are also proficient in simple or martial unarmed strikes.
</p>

<div id="House Rules-Currency"><h3 id="Currency" class="header"><a href="#House Rules-Currency">Currency</a></h3></div>

<p>
In Dashao, two currencies are produced: copper coins, and silver coins. Whatever the variety, coins are minted with holes in the middle, allowing them to be strung together for convenience.
</p>

<p>
A string of 10 copper coins is equivalent in value to a single silver coin. A string of 10 silver coins is one tael. Transactions involving more than a few taels of silver are often performed using ingots, gemstones, or bank notes, which have no standardized size.
</p>

<div id="House Rules-Inventory Space"><h3 id="Inventory Space" class="header"><a href="#House Rules-Inventory Space">Inventory Space</a></h3></div>

<p>
Adventuring requires a lot of stuff. Generally speaking, keeping track of all this stuff isn't very interesting. So, we can just assume that your character has access to all the basic necessities of adventuring - food, water, clothing, light sources, and so forth - without bothering to track them in perfect detail.
</p>

<p>
To track more interesting things, like magic items, valuable treasures, or useful tools, we'll use a slot system. The basic idea is that your character has a number of <em>slots</em> equal to 5 + their Strength modifier. A typical item takes up one slot of space (very large items might take up multiple slots, and very small items can be grouped together in a single slot). Once all of your slots are full, you can't carry any more.
</p>

<p>
Stuff that you get from your background doesn't take up any slots. Likewise for your armor, and up to one weapon (extra weapons beyond the first take up additional slots, however). If you're a spellcaster, your arcane focus or component pouch doesn't take up any slots either.
</p>

<p>
Your character can carry up to 100 coins on their person without taking slots, but after that, every 100 coins takes up a slot of inventory space. It can be convenient to get large sums of money converted to ingots, gemstones, or banknotes to avoid becoming overburdened.
</p>

<div id="House Rules-Resting"><h3 id="Resting" class="header"><a href="#House Rules-Resting">Resting</a></h3></div>

<p>
A long rest in Dashao requires a full week of downtime in a safe place - typically a town or city. During this time your character can pursue low-risk activities like shopping, research, networking, training, or working on other long term projects.
</p>

<p>
A short rest only requires a good night's sleep. Note that, while journeying, short rests are impossible unless you take it easy during the day.
</p>

<div id="House Rules-Experience"><h3 id="Experience" class="header"><a href="#House Rules-Experience">Experience</a></h3></div>

<p>
During play, your character gains experience from three sources: overcoming adversity, forging connections with other people in the world, and discovering hidden secrets. Experience points are handed out in real time as your character's accomplishments grow. During downtime, you can spend your week training and spend 100 experience points to level up.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<div id="House Rules-Journeys"><h3 id="Journeys" class="header"><a href="#House Rules-Journeys">Journeys</a></h3></div>

<p>
During the game, when your characters are travelling long distances on foot, we'll use special rules to determine how the journey goes. The full rules are described <a href="https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-M-H8kGbT2jf5F0NeXWg">here</a>, but this is the basic idea:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
First, the party decides where they want to go.

<li>
The DM gives them a choice between different routes they could take. For instance, one route might follow a safe road which goes out of the way, while another route might cut directly through a haunted swamp.

<li>
Once the party chooses a route, they allocate roles. One character is responsible for navigating, another for scouting, and a third for managing supplies and setting up camp. In this way, each character makes a unique contribution to the journey.

<li>
Finally, the party chooses how many supplies to purchase for the journey, and decides what pace they want to take. Going slow will make the journey longer, but reduce the risk of getting lost, while going fast does the opposite. You can also choose to take a medium pace, which has no special benefits or downsides.

<li>
Throughout the journey, the party will randomly encounter other creatures, deal with supply mishaps, discover interesting locations, and more.

</ul>
