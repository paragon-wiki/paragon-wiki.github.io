<p>
Monasteries are the homes and workplaces of monks of the <a href="Religion in Dashao.html#Five-Fold Path">Way of the Five-Fold Path</a>. At minimum, they consist of living quarters for the monastics, as well as rooms and courtyards for meditation and the burning of incense. Larger monasteries often include gardens, pavilions, and collections of relics which are tended to by the monks.
</p>

<p>
Each monastery is presided over by an abbot, who is responsible for admitting and training the monks under them. There is no official hierarchy between monastaries, but abbots generally maintain close communication with one another, and it is difficult to gain entry to the most prestigious monasteries without the recommendation of other well-regarded abbots.

<p>
Almost all monasteries are single-sex, containing exclusively male or exclusively female monks. In <a href="Shanyou People.html">Shanyou</a> lands, where the Way originated, they tend to lie a short distance away from the communities they serve, with the intent of protecting the monks from anything that might distract them from their responsibilities. In Dashao, this tradition is upheld to some extent, but it is more common to find monasteries directly in cities, sometimes operating in repurposed temples of <a href="Religion in Dashao.html#Wujiao">Wujiao</a>.
