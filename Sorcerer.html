<p>
The Sorcerer is one of the <a href="Class.html">13 playable classes</a> in the <a href="Dashao.html">Dashao</a> setting. 
</p>

<p>
A Sorcerer is created when a man or woman earns the admiration or gratitude of a powerful divine spirit, such as a Dragon or Phoenix. When this happens, the spirit will bless the mortal with their mark, granting them a font of magical power which bubbles forth almost effortlessly from within them. This gift can be passed on from generation to generation, but should the bloodline ever stray too far from the example of their ancestor, then the gift will run its course, and no new children will be born with it.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="Emperor.html">emperor or empress</a> is always a Draconic Sorcerer, and the continuation of the gift of sorcery is seen as an indication that the ruling family still enjoys <a href="Heaven.html">heavenâ€™s</a> favor. The chaos of the present era has been caused in part because neither of the two eldest children of the current Empress possess the gift, sparking rumors that the mandate to rule has been lost.

<p>
Sorcerers in Dashao use the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B40nce9YZ1MbZlpqMVp5bVJmTlU/view">Sorcerer, Tweaked</a> by u/SwordMeow. By default, Sorcerers can choose either the Draconic or Phoenix Soul bloodlines. Ask your DM if you would like to use a different subclass.
