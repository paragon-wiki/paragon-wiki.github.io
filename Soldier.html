<p>
War has been your life for as long as you care to remember. You trained as a youth, studied the use of weapons and armor, and learned basic survival techniques, including how to stay alive on the battlefield. You might have been part of the Imperial army or a mercenary company, or perhaps a member of a local militia who rose to prominence during a recent war.
