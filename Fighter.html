<p>
Fighters are one of the <a href="Class.html">13 playable classes</a> in the <a href="Dashao.html">Dashao</a> setting.
</p>

<p>
Any brute can swing an axe, but a true Fighter elevates their martial skill to an art form. In the course of their studies, a typical Fighter will learn and master multiple schools of martial arts, and become at least familiar with every one of the 18 weapons, in addition to unarmed strikes and grappling. More importantly, however, they learn discipline, patience, and artistry, and even the most impudent and hot-headed of Fighters tend to have a degree of subtlety and reflectiveness that sets them apart from simple soldiers.
