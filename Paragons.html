<p>
In the year 374, a then relatively obscure priest of <a href="Religion in Dashao.html#Wujiao">Wujiao</a> by the name of <a href="Zhao Jiang.html">Zhao Jiang</a> issued a prophecy. <a href="Heaven.html">Heaven</a>, he said, was displeased with the <a href="Shao Dynasty.html">Shao</a>. Through the influence of corrupt eunuchs and ambitious courtiers, the ruling family had grown indolent and withdrawn, caring little for the fate of the people. To bring peace and stability to the land once more, 108 spirits had descended from heaven to be born as humans, destined in their adulthood to cleanse the corruption of the Shao.
</p>

<p>
This prophecy captured the imagination of millions throughout the empire, sparking many subsequent prophecies as well as numerous scholarly essays debating or clarifying their meaning. <a href="Empress Zhishen.html">The Empress</a>, alarmed by the rapidly spreading murmurs of dissent, had Zhao Jiang arrested on charges of sedition and exiled to <a href="Hu Province.html">Hu Province</a>, but this did little to dampen the power of his words. 
</p>

<p>
In subsequent years, theologians came to agree that the spirits Zhao Jiang described did exist, and in fact had already been incarnated as humans, who came to be referred to as Paragons. They disagreed fiercely, however, on one crucial point: what, exactly, the Paragons were destined to do. Some conservative scholars believed that they would bring about a second golden age of the Shao, fighting against the enemies of the empire both within and without its borders. Others whispered in secret that they would found a new dynasty, continuous with the Shao but ruled by the Paragons themselves. Zhao Jiang, who gave sermons from the window of his jail cell, claimed that they would destroy the Shao and create a radical new utopia, ruled in accordance with the principles of Wujiao.

<p>
The first Paragon definitively identified as such was a woman named <a href="Xu Neng.html">Xu Neng</a>, already well regarded in the capital for her knowledge of the classics and talent as a <a href="Wizard.html">wizard</a>. To the frustration of the theologians, however, she admitted to having no memory of her time as a heavenly spirit, and little understanding of the role which Heaven wanted her to play. Nonetheless, she was immediately granted high office in the imperial court, in which capacity she has helped to bolster the Shao and suppress the <a href="White Dragons.html">peasant rebellion</a> instigated by Zhao Jiang from his prison in Hu Province.
</p>

<p>
There is no definitive test to determine if someone is a Paragon. Most are young - typically in their 20s or 30s - but paragons as old as 70 have been identified. Many of them were already well known in their home communities for their remarkable talents. And all of them reported having long felt a sort of yearning within them, calling them to do great things.
</p>

<p>
The current year is 383, and some three to four dozen Paragons have been identified, emerging onto the national stage at an accelerating rate. Some, like Xu Neng, have assumed positions in the imperial court. Others remain in the retinues of the provincal governors. Still more wander the land alone, unsure of their responsibilities and unwilling to commit themselves too hastily to any one cause. And a not-inconsiderable number of them have joined forces with the growing peasant rebellion, taking up the call to depose the Shao entirely.
