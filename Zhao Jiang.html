<p>
Zhao Jiang is a priest, healer, and prophet responsible for instigating the White Dragon rebellion. He first gained widespread recognition for prophecizing the arrival of the Paragons in the year 374, and has since become one of the central figures of the the age, variously revered and vilified in almost every corner of the land.
</p>

<p>
Zhao Jiang was born in Jin province to a family of peasants. From an early age, he showed a keen interest in religion, and his parents sponsored his education at a local temple. He came to be well regarded as a preacher and healer, and attracted a small but devoted following for his willingness to work for free on the behalf of peasants with no means to pay.

<p>
In the year 374, he claims to have been visited by The Dark Lady, goddess of magic, sex, and war, who bestowed upon him a scroll of heavenly wisdom. From this scroll, he learned many techniques of magical healing, which he used to perform numerous public miracles. He also learned of the coming of the Paragons, news of which he spread through his ever-growing group of followers. Word travelled quickly, and his message found many receptive ears.

<p>
The imperial court was concerned by the seditious overtones of the prophecy, and in 375, Zhao Jiang was arrested and exiled to a penal colony in Hu Province, a rural backwater far from the capital. There, his visions continued, and he persisted in preaching to anyone who would come to listen. Finally, in 379, he revealed to his following that the Shao was too far gone, and that heaven demanded its destruction. His followers enthusiastically took up arms, freed him from his prison, and began spreading news of the rebellion throughout the empire.

<p>
For the past four years, Zhao Jiang has resided in his base in Hu Province, from which he directs the rebellion and issues new prophecies decrying the excess of the Empress and rallying the common people to throw down their oppressors.
