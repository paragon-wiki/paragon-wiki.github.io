Empress Zhishen (born Lei Zong) is the 35th <a href="Emperor.html">monarch</a> of the Shao Dynasty. She succeeded her father, the <a href="Yizong Emperor.html">Yizong Emperor</a>, at the age of 26, marking the beginning of the <a href="Era of Overflowing Compassion.html">Era of Overflowing Compassion</a>. For most of her fourteen-year reign she has been a reclusive ruler, appearing in public only during sacred festivals, and little is widely known about her life or personality.

Altho Empress Zhishen herself is known to be a powerful <a href="Sorcerer.html">Draconic Sorcerer</a>, she has struggled to produce an heir. Of her three living children, two have been shown to definitely lack the gift of sorcery, while the third is still too young for her powers to manifest. The uncertainty surrounding the line of succession is one of the major factors leading to the chaos of the present day. Her living relatives include two younger brothers, named <a href="Lei Chuo.html">Lei Chuo</a> and <a href="Lei Fan.html">Lei Fan</a>.
