Hu province is one of the <a href="Province.html">10 provinces</a> of <a href="Dashao.html">Dashao</a>. Large and sparsely populated, is lies in the south east of the empire. It is surrounded on all sides by imposing mountains peaks, home to the <a href="Shanyou People.html">Shanyou</a>, and most of its predominantly rural population lives in the wide and verdent basin which separates the mountain ranges.

<p>
After a series of devastating earthquakes and floods left tens of thousands without homes or livelihoods, Hu Province became the center of the <a href="White Dragon cult.html">White Dragon Rebellion</a>, as thousands of peasants united under the charismatic preacher <a href="Zhao Jiang.html">Zhao Jiang</a> to topple the <a href="Shao Dynasty.html">Shao</a>. The rebels of Hu Province made considerable gains in the first year of the rebellion, assuming control of over half of the populated land in the province and defeating the imperial army through a combination of coordinated skirmishing and the assassination of the grand commandant. Their progress was arrested, however, after the governor of Hu province raised his own volunteer army to suppress the rebellion. Today, Hu province is locked in a proctracted war, which in many cases has pit cousin against cousin, or parent against child.
