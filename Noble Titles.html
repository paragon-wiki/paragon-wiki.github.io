<p>
In ancient times, Dashao was ruled by feudal lords and ladies, who paid obeisance to the Emperor but ruled independently in practice. Today, however, these titles have been stripped of their authority, and are handed out relatively freely as rewards to effective officials and bribes to entice rebels and bandits to lay down their arms. These modern nobles remain responsible for collecting taxes from the households they preside over - and are entitled to skim from the top - but otherwise have no official power.

Of course, many such noble families end up becoming quite wealthy, particularly if they use the capital gained from their tax collection to fund other ventures. And so, in practice, these families end up being quite influential politically, and use their wealth and privilege to procure prestigious positions in the military or bureaucracy for their children.

A noble title is only ever borne by one individual at a time, but they are hereditary. The exact title given depends on the number of households the individual presides over. They are, in order from least to most prestigious: Baron(ess), Viscount(ess), Count(ess), Lord/Lady, and Duke/Duchess. The final rank is reserved for members of the imperial <a href="Clan.html">clan</a> alone.
