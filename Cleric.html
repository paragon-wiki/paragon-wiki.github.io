<p>
Clerics are one of the <a href="Class.html">13 playable classes</a> in the <a href="Dashao.html">Dashao</a> setting.
</p>

<p>
Clerics in Dashao are a diverse group, and can belong to any of the major religious traditions. Clerics who follow the teachings of <a href="Wujiao.html">Wujiao</a> generally worship the <a href="Azure Emperor.html">Azure Emperor</a> and some or all of his many attendants in <a href="Heaven.html">Heaven</a>, and see themselves as being tasked with bringing the mortal world in line with Heavenâ€™s will. Those who primarily follow <a href="Lixue.html">Lixue</a> instead focus their efforts on <a href="Ancestor Worship.html">ancestor worship</a>, deriving their powers through the favor of their ancestors, and striving to defend their homeland. Those who walk the <a href="The Way of the Five-Fold Path.html">Five Fold Path</a> instead worship the <a href="Damas.html">saints</a> who have attained enlightenment and now intervene in mortal affairs to guide others to enlightenment as well.
</p>

<p>
Mechanically: Clerics in Dashao are not proficient in light or medium armor. In exchange, they gain Unarmored Defense. While not wearing armor or wielding a shield, their AC is equal to 10 + their Wisdom modifier + their Dexterity modifier. If their domain would grant them proficiency in heavy armor, then they can instead benefit from a shield while using their Unarmored Defense.
