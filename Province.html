<p>
Provinces are the largest administrative division in <a href="Dashao.html">Dashao</a>. Each province is presided over by a <a href="Governor.html">Governor</a>, who is centrally appointed by the <a href="Emperor.html">Empress</a>. Provinces are subdivided into <a href="County.html">counties</a>, which are in turn broken up into <a href="Township.html">townships</a>.
</p>

<p>
The past several decades have seen the influence of the central government steadily declining, with the result that, in practice, most provinces are ruled as semi-independent nations in their own right. This trend has been greatly accelerated following the defeat of the imperial army by the forces of the <a href="White Dragons.html">White Dragon Rebellion</a> during the 11th year of the <a href="Era of Overflowing Compassion.html">Era of Overflowing Compassion</a>, after which the Empress issued an edict giving governors permission to raise private armies to suppress the rebellion.

<p>
There are a total of 10 provinces in Dashao, as well as the capital, which is ruled directly by the Empress:
